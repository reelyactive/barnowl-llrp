barnowl-llrp
============

__barnowl-llrp__ converts the decodings of _any_ ambient RAIN RFID tags by readers supporting the Low-Level Reader Protocol (LLRP) into standard developer-friendly JSON that is vendor/technology/application-agnostic.

![Overview of barnowl-llrp](https://reelyactive.github.io/barnowl-llrp/images/overview.png)

__barnowl-llrp__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl-llrp) that can run on resource-constrained edge devices as well as on powerful cloud servers and anything in between.  It supports native integration with reelyActive's [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source middleware suite, and can just as easily be run standalone behind a [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) instance, as detailed in the code examples below.


Getting Started
---------------

Learn "owl" about the __raddec__ JSON data output:
-  [reelyActive Developer's Cheatsheet](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/cheatsheet/)


Quick Start
-----------

Clone this repository, install package dependencies with `npm install`, and then from the root folder run at any time:

    npm start xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

__barnowl-llrp__ will connect with the reader at IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and output (flattened) __raddec__ JSON to the console.


Hello barnowl-llrp!
-------------------

Developing an application directly from __barnowl-llrp__?  Start by pasting the code below into a file called server.js:

```javascript
const Barnowl = require('barnowl');
const BarnowlLlrp = require('barnowl-llrp');

let barnowl = new Barnowl({ enableMixing: true });

barnowl.addListener(BarnowlLlrp, {}, BarnowlLlrp.TcpSocketListener,
                    { host: "12.34.56.78" });

barnowl.on('raddec', (raddec) => {
  console.log(raddec);
  // Trigger your application logic here
});
```

From the same folder as the server.js file, install package dependencies with the commands `npm install barnowl-llrp` and `npm install barnowl`.  Then run the code with the command `node server.js` and observe the stream of radio decodings (raddec objects) output to the console:

```javascript
{
  transmitterId: "a00000000000000000001234",
  transmitterIdType: 5,
  rssiSignature: [
    {
      receiverId: "001625ffffffffff",
      receiverIdType: 1,
      rssi: -42,
      numberOfDecodings: 1
    }
  ],
  timestamp: 1645568542222
}
```

See the [Supported Listener Interfaces](#supported-listener-interfaces) below to adapt the code to listen for your gateway(s).


Supported Listener Interfaces
-----------------------------

The following listener interfaces are supported by __barnowl-llrp__.

### TCP Socket

```javascript
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlLlrp, {}, BarnowlLlrp.TcpSocketListener,
                    { host: "12.34.56.78", port: 5084 });
```


Pareto Anywhere Integration
---------------------------

__barnowl-llrp__ includes a script to forward data to a local [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) instance as UDP raddecs with target localhost:50001.  Start this script with the command:

    npm run forwarder xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of the reader.


Compatible RFID Readers
-----------------------

__barnowl-llrp__ has been validated with the following readers:

- Impinj R420

In theory, _any_ LLRP-compatible reader should be compatible.


Is that owl you can do?
-----------------------

While __barnowl-llrp__ may suffice standalone for simple real-time applications, its functionality can be greatly extended with the following software packages:
- [advlib-epc](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib-epc) to decode the Electronic Product Code (EPC) into JSON
- [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) to combine parallel streams of RF decoding data in a technology-and-vendor-agnostic way

These packages and more are bundled together as the [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere) open source middleware suite, which includes a variety of __barnowl-x__ listeners, APIs and interactive web apps.
